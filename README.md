# Learning Python Projects

## Description

This repository contains various **personal Python projects** used for **learning Python** through hands-on practice. It serves as a **personal showcase** that displays practical applications created to deepen understanding in various Python topics, from **Python basics**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, to **Web Development**.

This repository is not meant to teach others but rather to store and manage the projects I’m working on to enhance my Python knowledge.

## How to Use

### 1. **Installation**

* **Prerequisites:**

  * Python 3.x must be installed on your computer.
  * No additional packages are required for **BeginnerLearningPath** since it uses standard Python modules.
* **Installation Steps for Web Development (Flask and Django):**

  * Install the following packages using **pip**:

    ```bash
    pip install flask django
    ```

### 2. **Running Scripts**

* Copy the **learningPython** folder to your desired directory.
* Navigate to the relevant folder according to the topic you want to explore (e.g., **WebLearningPath** for Flask/Django).
* Run the script by using the following command:

  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
