# Machine Learning Learning Path

## Description
This folder focuses on learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning (ML) using Python. You will learn how to use **Scikit-learn** to implement algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering, along with model evaluation techniques.

## Topics Covered:
- Supervised Learning (Regression and Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Feature Selection and Engineering
- Introduction to Neural Networks (Optional)

## How to Use:
1. Run through the Python scripts to understand basic ML algorithms.
2. Use **Scikit-learn** to implement various ML models.
3. Experiment with different datasets to improve your models.
